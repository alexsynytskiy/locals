                            A perilous rift is born of the ambiguity of war and peace, the abyss that the essence sinks into. It perishes while the world scatters in panic. In the spaces that we expected to offer us the salvation of values opens the abyss, an absence, an unsprung trap. We slip into the rift between wrongdoing and the crime of omission.
                            <br>The first year of the war might have passed, but that doesn’t make it any more normal. Time slows down and replicates, day in day out, its soggy banality. We are almost out of rage, fire and enthusiasm, with nothing but mounting exhaustion to replace them. We grow used to anxiety, yet numbness does little to protect. We grow used to grief, yet that doesn’t help either: on the contrary, grief accumulates, adds up, crystallizes.
                            <br>We got trapped in the time that goes stale and rots without changing. We are so worn down by anxiety that we want to escape not only the war, but also the peace that nurtures the war. Whence does danger come? Even peace is a danger, frayed as it is by the unwavering threat of a yet bigger war. Our chimaera of peace festers in borrowed time, and we’ll yet have to pay for it.
                            <br>When Bomb Shelter markings started cropping up on the walls in Kyiv, it seemed like a quaint anachronism, a thing straight out of civic defense classes in Soviet schools. Bomb shelters for air raids reminded us that we do still have a quantity of calm, set aside against a rainy day. It’s symbolic that occasionally the markings led nowhere, with not a shelter in sight.
                            <br>Shelter, the second part of our project, is defined by this search for a shelter in unexpected places, in emptiness (in silence).
                            <br>We were working on Poet’s Refuge in Kaniv last year, when the events were still unfolding with overwhelming speed. We explored whether poetic language can become a weapon, and what role an artist can play in times that can be described as extreme. We didn’t have time for redefinitions: the world was turning upside down right as we were watching. Everything was changing too fast. Everything seemed to brim with action.

                        <div class="column">
                            Now events seem to endlessly repeat themselves. We’ve spent the last year in a world whose outlines were washed away by this strange war; reality became muddled, ill defined. After familiar objects exhausted themselves and could no longer serve their functions, we lost our footing. The world wastes and wanes in mundanely devouring itself. It probably can devour itself in ambiguity, because the old familiar definitions no longer apply. Mundane language devolved to inane chatter, no longer fit to narrate or explain.
                            Artists, however, don’t have a choice but to keep talking to the world and to themselves, not that there’s much of a difference, because only language can shelter both.
                            <br>Outside of language, the world wastes away, but then, so does artistic language, if the world uses it in vain. (Doesn’t the empty imitation of language remind us of sham bomb shelter signs that imperil the lives of those who can’t tell language and non-language apart?)
                            <br>We should lead language back to silence, its temporary shelter.
                            <br>Only artistic language, artists’ haven and shelter, can lay bare the ambiguous world that we’ve found ourselves in. The language itself, however, also needs renewing, since words are depleted of meaning in mundane speech. Such shelters function as the silence and mysterious red lights of dark rooms, in which photographs emerge out of blank surfaces.
                            <br>Kaniv studios resemble both a dark room and a shelter. Working there feels like descending into an empty shelter, where speaking in silence runs parallel to restless reality. Therefore, we don’t have much of a choice but to try to slip back inside, into the primeval expanse and stillness, where ambiguity has not yet bred anxiety and indifference. To the contrary, it still harbours potential actions and an ability to discern, recognize and define the surrounding objects.

                            Our expectations of art are so specific as to be almost utilitarian. Individual viewers tend to expect aesthetic pleasure, while society demands that art assert, illustrate or affirm its dominant ideology. Art critics assume that art should analyze reality and prod it towards changes. Artists are constantly under scrutiny, as if they are sitting for an exam. That might be true, but the artist need only pass muster with himself, and with history.
                            <br>History and artists exist in constant tension with each other, with not a chance of catharsis. Only history can pass the final judgments that won’t ever reach the artist. History made Johann Sebastian Bach into the greatest composer of the Baroque period, long after both the style and its other adherents had drifted into obscurity. History made Marquis de Sade into a 20th century philosopher, since that’s the era that was defined, both in deeds and in thoughts, by the colossal projects of the new world and the new man for which humanity had to pay in ghastly mechanistic cruelty.
                            <br>However, artists also hasten history along. It’s their fate: to denominate, to name the surrounding phenomena. Images precede thought, denominate the future and present it to the world, long before these events, these discoveries come to pass. To name is to prophesy, or to warn.
                            <br>Artists are the nervous system of humanity: they sense pleasure and pain earlier than the rest of the body.
                            <br>Artists want to hasten the world along. Why else would they work? Even the vainest among them know that the recognition of contemporaries is but an illusion.
                            In the tragic times of drastic and painful social shifts, artists manifest their essence: they are “wounded healers.” The archetype of Verwundeter Heiler was introduced by a Swiss analyst Adolf Guggenbühl-Craig: it evokes the image of Asclepius, the god of medicine in Greek mythology, who himself suffered from physical pain. Guggenbühl-Craig contends that doctors who have personal experience of an ailment can devise more effective therapy, but the experience also makes them more prone to sadistic outbreaks. However, healing is often impossible without drastic measures, and each artist is prone to sadistic violence. He violates the world with his works, which not a soul had asked for.
                            <br>Guernica by Pablo Picasso is one of the most important works of the type in the 20th century. It is one of the most penetrating and realistic documents of the era of colossal modernist projects of total revolutions that bled over into total wars.
                            <br>Such conscious violence is typical of the works of Volodymyr Budnikov and Vlada Ralko. They are confident, willful artists, driven by their own sensibilities and the raw will to express, rather than by trends, the logic of an instilled tradition, social demands or even by rational analysis.
                            <br>Therefore, Budnikov and Ralko cannot be described as a tandem. They stay in dialogue. Yet the dialogue is stripped of all shreds of conformity, both in the microcosm of their conversation and in the broader context of the country or the world. The Shelter Project marks a milestone in their dialogue and highlights its most salient features. Both artists stay true to themselves, and both evoke the catastrophe through their recognizable imagery. There’s no obvious shelter for those caught in it.
                            <br>Through all the stages of his career, Volodymyr Budnikov’s sensibility was marked by the understanding of the world as an ongoing catastrophe. He explored the motif through landscapes, through the images of nature, which are always born of the strife of elements and organisms. The scholars of Budnikov’s works are often tempted to mention the Baroque style with its catastrophic worldview. For decades, Budnikov has been exploring the future, with all its unpredictable shifts, anxieties and anguishes, through landscapes. His gaze is unflinching, since he knows that life, in all its anguish and glory, is contained in movement. Each tree that breaks out of its seed in a titanic spasm is in movement. Each boulder, the meanderings of rivers are born of the planetary drama of movement.
                            <br>Humanity flees from understanding, seeking shelter from changes; they eschew

                        <div class="column">
                            the naming by hiding behind vague phrases, catchy mottoes, vulgarities, and parodies. This is but another reminder that our biological species teeters on the verge of self-destruction.
                            These days, Budnikov’s works erupt into a series of nuclear explosions, and it’s not a warning: he’s merely naming the world. It’s the world that may linger, in all its anguish and glory, but it would be swept clean of people. Within the context of natural elements, a nuclear explosion belongs to the sphere of the aesthetic. It bespeaks the grandeur of natural aesthetics.
                            <br>The nuclear explosion series by Budnikov offers a synthesis of his landscapes and nonfigurative works. The series is centered upon the will and conflicts. Lines, colours, textures remain in a perpetual orgiastic confrontation.
                            V<br>lada Ralko is closer to Gustav Meyrink, a Czech writer who believed that the uncanny and the dramatic, the most eerie demons rein supreme in the quotidian, in the mundane. Budnikov explores landscapes; Ralko denominates sexuality on the crossroads between the biological and the social. Both grant names to the captivatingly uncanny: the inexorability of changes. It’s life, viewed as a series of metamorphoses.
                            The works created for the Shelter series partly overlap with the Kyiv Diary, the cycle conceived during Maidan – honest, powerful, shameless in its despair and startlingly humane in its vulnerability. Meyrink’s image of feet that follow one another in a circle became a mystical metaphor of the rise of Nazism. Rhinocéros by Eugène Ionesco laid bare the anamnesis of a citizen turning into a beast. The prints by Francisco José de Goya depicted the impending darkness of the mind that came to believe that war is the vehicle of technical progress. Similarly, the interplay of biomorphic and zoomorphic beings in Ralko’s works draws our attention to the phenomena that already permeate our existence. There’s no point to seeking shelter from them in the quotidian, since the yearning for the somnolent mundane became the breeding grounds for the bacteria of war.
                            <br>In stark contrast to these drawings, Ralko forgoes direct emotional responses in her paintings of the Shelter cycle. Their unwavering suspense is evocative of Alfred Hitchcock’s films: the anticipation is more horrifying than any actual horrors. The cycle culminates in the landscape with folded umbrellas, the kind you see on beaches or in outdoor cafes. What do these evoke? The closing of a nice day? The closing of a tourist season? Or is it the final, imminent closure?
                            <br>An umbrella looks like a mushroom. It calls up the absurd aesthetic conciseness of the project of Enver Hoxha, a socialist leader of Albania. At a certain point, he started to propagate the idea that the entire world had turned against Albania, one of the most closed-off countries. Albania was on the verge of nuclear destruction. The citizens were charged with building small family fallout shelters, absurd cement structures that pepper Albania to this day like giant mushrooms. It’s the most grandiose installation of paranoia, a metaphor of mock-shelters.
                            <br>In Budnikov’s drawings, mushroom clouds spring up like bright lines in a cardiogram. Georges Bataille contended that the ocean is a metaphor of monumental masturbation; similarly, a nuclear explosion may evoke a planetary orgasm, a cosmic catharsis. Sure, nobody will live to see this art object, so you might as well enjoy it while you last.
                            <br>Our best hope for a shelter, if there is one, lies in trying to come to our senses, open our eyes, break free of the darkness of our own making. Only then will we manage not only to save ourselves, but to also save someone else.

                            First, I drew a nuclear explosion like a tree
                            with a spreading crown that sheltered
                            iconic characters of classical paintings.
                            However, the parallels between mushroom
                            clouds and trees in pastoral landscapes,
                            or with giant umbrellas, were so expressive
                            that I concentrated exclusively on these
                            dangerously exquisite silhouettes. It’s not
                            the explosions that bespeak the changed

                            With a war that’s not even called a war
                            in the background, mundane, peaceful
                            objects seem to come to a boil, as if you
                            were examining quotidian things through
                            the screen broadcasting the latest news.
                            Even misleadingly unchanged objects
                            are imperceptibly different. Our normal
                            surroundings screech out warnings, even
                            as they seem to exude calm. War appears to
                            have seeped under the skin of our peaceful
                            life, and it can break through the surface
                            of any mundane scene. There’s a hint of
                            disquiet in a picnic on the beach, a roof
                            being renovated, an evening stroll.

                                        What is an artist to do in a world that is turning upside down? We had to confront the question the very moment it all started. Do artists have to “hone” change or otherwise adjust their tools in order to stay in touch with the changed world? Everything was changing so fast that it seemed like we didn’t have a choice but to hasten too. Speaking for myself, I decided that staying silent or continuing on as if nothing had happened wasn’t appropriate, no more so than sticking exclusively to activism. Since the very first days of the protests in Ukraine, the events were unfolding, one might say, right in front of our eyes. Some crucial facts could be lost, garbled by time or interpretations, or even deliberately changed to provide a more acceptable and intelligible version of reality. I feared that some things could be lost or forgotten just because we didn’t have the distance or time for reflection.

                                        Actually, I don’t think that artists should deliberately engage with the obvious changes in their artistic practices. Moreover, I’m suspicious of any such direct responses, even to such harrowing events as ours, because an artist cannot look at his or her subjects directly. Direct viewing is unreliable. Besides, how do you tell whether it’s the artist’s take on the event that is important and urgent, or the event itself? Should we hold artists hostage to such superficial urgency? If an artist tries to cover events before the media do and starts to spout op-eds, doesn’t that devalue art? Is there the one true and tried protocol for artists in times of great calamities?
                                        <br>I’m not saying that artists shouldn’t have opinions on matters of public importance, but when it comes to art, that’s not how these opinions should be expressed. Civic and artistic practices shouldn’t overlap. Maybe the artists whose works don’t evidence a marked shift just view the changed world from a different perspective? Maybe the world started to change way before the shift became evident?
                                        <br>Such lightning-fast artistic reactions can be viewed as catering to the expectations of the audience, wouldn’t you say? The events that happened in Kyiv and continue unfolding in the east are too complex. People get lost in their own ambiguity. The world became too unstable, uncertain, unsafe, and people don’t know how to react. Even the indolent indifference which they always believed to be safe failed to protect them. With so much grief, so many dead, and the abounding struck-down idols, they had to fill the vacant spaces in their heads, pronto. Like in “the good old days,” the artists of the ideologue persuasion are keen to hold up their end of the “social deal,” of the sort. Ring any bells?
                                        <br>It sometimes seems that, in times of war, artists are expected to instantly procure an explanation to the new realities, an updated panorama of Us versus Them.

                                        Lately one often hears that “an artist doesn’t owe anybody a thing.” Tempting as it might sound, I find such sweeping generalizations overtly populist. Sure, an overly hasty artistic response to the recent events might elicit certain suspicions, but there’s no template for such reactions. An artist has the right to an instant “heated” response, much as he or she has the right to remain silent. Not to mention that silence, too, can bespeak a civic stance, defiance, even rage.
                                        <br>It’s the artists that face the multitude of challenges and potential pitfalls; their position is especially precarious, loaded and charged. Attempts at hasty generalizations about recent events, when there’s no critical distance yet, might yield a distorted picture. Such distortions, in their turn, warp artistic language until it’s stripped of all meaning.
                                        It might seem that the artists who are active these days, in times of war, continue on with their earlier projects. The impression persists despite outward changes in their works. Obviously, many of them sensed the coming shifts when everything still appeared calm.
                                        <br>When we worked on “Poet’s Refuge” in Kaniv, only snippets of conversations, like the mentions about a new wave of military drafts, reminded us about the war in the east. Our studios next to Chernecha Mountain were quiet, eerily quiet, I would even say. There was no telling how we should navigate around the jarring contrast between the horrifying news from the east and the immobile shapes of fishermen mirrored in the almost perfect stillness of the Dnieper. The ambiguity was uncanny: are the fishermen completely calm, or is the calm only skin-deep? Is the quiet landscape really calm? We’ve never experienced anything like that calm!
                                        <br>The war might have been distant, but there was no escaping it. Therefore, we had to select the elements of the peaceful and somnolent reality that best conveyed the impression of the war. But we only knew about the war from the news. How could we cope with the media that gradually turned the news into a theatre of cynicism? The war might have been distant, but the fact that we were a ten minutes’ walk away from Taras Shevchenko’s grave, and, thus, always close to the majestic and tragic poet, allowed us a special perspective.
                                        <br>By the way, Shevchenko wrote his long poem “Haidamaky” in Saint Petersburg, surrounded by high society; he himself marveled at the contrast between his carefree milieu and the riveting and cruel history that he was describing. Despite all that, he described the historical events as if he witnessed them. Hence, I’m not really sure who qualifies as a witness. In a way, Shevchenko might have been a true witness to the Cossack rebellion known as Koliyivshchyna that he described from a distance. His long poem “Haidamaky” offers indisputable proof of that. It can be read as testimony about those events, because certain crucial moments inevitably slip through the lines of even the most meticulously arranged documents, while artists can reconstruct them, pull them forward through the cracks of time, preserve them and bring them back to life. Some things either don’t fit documentary sources, or get corrupted in them. Works of art, meanwhile, can be the best repositories for the essential.
                                        <br>Do artists have to participate in events in order to depict them? None of this brings us any closer to answering this question. I think it’s a pressing question in times of war. I don’t yet have the answer, yet I thought that retreating back to my studio and continuing to work as if nothing had happened would have been immoral. In times of war, finding shelter from the real in a safe haven of a studio felt like treason. Staying a sheltered studio artist rather than an active citizen, activist, soldier felt like treason.
                                        Kaniv also felt like such a safe haven, eerily calm in its split from reality.

                                        Artists often appear eerily calm, yet it does not necessarily connote indifference or the depths of immorality. They can explore the most horrifying things with an “eerie calm,” or notice the unspeakable tension in an ostensibly calm reality. They may evoke images from the past, no matter how distant or recent, to draw our attention to the essence of the here and now. The so-called urgency of such a perspective has nothing to do with the news. Moreover, the best publicized or the most stunning events don’t necessarily convey the essence; sometimes I find retreating to the periphery much more crucial.

                                        The outskirts of Kaniv, next to the Chernecha Mountain, were just such a much-needed periphery. All the while, they also remained central to the Shevchenko mythos, an almost sacred symbol of Ukraine.
                                        <br>The tranquil, almost timeless energy of the Chernecha Mountain nurtured me through my work. Meanwhile, the year when we celebrated 200 years since Shevchenko’s birth left me somewhat perplexed: the destructive force of artificial actualization seemed to disperse any utterance about Shevchenko, or his words even, and to strip them of power.
                                        <br>It seemed like we were forced to evoke Shevchenko, tasked with referencing him. It became a rallying cry for collective atonement, or collective defusing of the overpowering, dangerous force of his poetry. Once pushed to the forefront of the news, Shevchenko became either repulsive or tamed.
                                        <br>Therefore, I had to avoid all images that we associate with Shevchenko, all images that were rammed to the forefront. I had more interest in the forces behind them, the invisible forces lurking in the darkness, not featured in any celebrations, seemingly unimportant. It didn’t mean that they were not important.

                                        I would like to argue that avoiding the topic du jour can be as limiting as adhering to it. Obviously, when you are in the thick of battle, you cannot keep it at arm’s length.
                                        <br>When I was in the tranquil Kaniv, the situation changed somewhat, but not much. The events at the front lines unfolded so vertiginously fast that reality crushed any and all attempts to regain our bearing and make sense of it. However, the most eye-catching phenomena, the ones that washed up on the shore, so to speak, also direct us back to the depths. My artistic choices were determined by dense dramatic reality, the staggering shifts in the familiar world, the horrifying carnival of life and death. I had to grab this reality, whole chunks of it, the fragments of real time, without waiting to analyze or grasp the entirety of it.
                                        <br>While staying at Poet’s Refuge, I added several pages to the Kyiv Diary that I began back in the late 2013, as the Euromaidan protests were starting. By creating a multitude of drawings, a diary of a kind, I avoided generalizations, the pitfalls of “glorifying” or “idealizing.” It also allowed me to put down everything that was happening without editorializing, no matter how difficult or perverse.

                                        It’s worth noting that the essence always hides in between the events. For example, there’s a subtle yet staggering power in the constant, unwavering energy of the landscape that, if old pictures are to be trusted, hasn’t changed since Shevchenko’s time. Maybe we are fighting the war precisely to preserve this unwavering calm, like the one you see in this landscape.
                                        <br>Don’t you see, in the markedly simple lines of the landscape, that the air between the trees is pulsating with the war?
                                        <br>It’s the things that remain quiet even now that are the most stunning. They somehow undermine the restless reality of the last months to prove their authenticity. In times of war, these calm objects are brimming with war too: war glorifies and elevates them, because, in a certain perverse way, war is the most substantial proof of their existence and authenticity.

                                        Quite. I also had the feeling that the calm, peaceful objects were transformed and laid bare their unknown, obscure essence. I don’t have the words to explain it, yet these objects reflected the war too. For example, when I started working at the Kaniv studio, I switched on the recordings of traditional Ukrainian folk lullabies. I didn’t even think about it much: I just had the recordings. Lullabies are supposed to soothe, yet, to the contrary, they unveiled and laid bare some important aspects of our new war. The weird thing is, babies, the primary audience of lullabies, do not yet know all the words, and, hence, perceive them unconsciously, uncritically, as a matter of faith. These days, in times of war, I took to recreating the images from lullabies in a new, modern setting, and they acquired elements of hyper-reality. There’s many a horror story in the old lullabies, yet in times of peace they don’t usually work, they go into sleep mode.

                                        Artistic utterances are another sort of information altogether. Sure, you can grasp at “information” as your key word. Art definitely carries vital information, but does it have practical implications? Otherwise, what’s the use of such information? The answer is, everybody already knows the truths that artists voice. Or knew, anyway, and misplaced them as useless or not immediately applicable.
                                        <br>Something similar is happening to Shevchenko: he’s been ripped to quotes that can be used in any situation, because his poetry remains aggravating; you cannot twist it to fit your circumstances, it transcends the limitations of discrete situations. Poetic word is cut of a different cloth. It’s larger than life.
                                        <br>Speaking of Chernecha Mountain, where Shevchenko is buried: its slopes are an unusable landscape. Nobody lives on or around it. Shevchenko himself couldn’t have settled there. Nobody knows what to do about this iconic space. It seems to exist outside of our quotidian life, in another space entirely. All I’m saying is, it’s as if Shevchenko created the landscape by describing it. He created himself a house, but he couldn’t use it, couldn’t enter the house on the mountain that he dreamed into existence, because that house existed on another plane. You couldn’t find a better example: the poet eventually entered the world of his own making after his death.
                                        <br>The Kaniv reservoir is all too symbolic: it reconfigured the iconic landscape that Shevchenko dreamed up from his vantage point on Chernecha Mountain. The reservoir supports the Kaniv Hydroelectric Power Plant, that is, it helps to produce energy. Hence, the energy of the “howling and groaning” Dnieper, as Shevchenko described it, was yoked to quotidian needs. Quite possibly, the good deed destroyed the poetic energy of the iconic landscape: these days, it is dispersed over the changed landscape, marred by the shapes of artificial buildings.
                                        <br>In my works “Reservoir” and “By the Dnieper,” I concentrated on the waterline that seems pregnant with the energy that Shevchenko brought forth. Outwardly, the landscape is perfectly still, somnolent. It’s another kind of energy that cannot go to waste: it remains calm and steady, the kind of energy that doesn’t disperse, stays constant in its existence.

                                        I’d note that the calm energy that you are describing is in no way synonymous to consistency. To the contrary, the energy of that kind by its very nature resents being pinned down, being affixed determined meanings.
                                        <br>It occurred to me that artists might be living embodiments of such energy, since all their works come from a single source that does not run dry. They also destroy any reality that they chose, or, rather, undermine its stable foundations, setting it in motion. Otherwise they run the risk of being trapped by the system.
                                        <br>These days, as yet another political scaffolding is collapsing, I have to confront the question: can an artist cope with reality? Meaning, can art become a weapon? Probably not. But maybe it can become a useful tool.

                                        I elevated an axe on a pedestal as a paragon of just such a tool. I didn’t have to invent a thing. When I was staying in a village in the summer, it dawned on me that an axe, stuck vertically in a log, resembles monument on a pedestal. Maybe it’s a monument to Action or, rather, to Potential Action that can turn to Active Action at the least need. I painted many axes in Kaniv, in Poet’s Refuge. Of course, there was no working around “Shevchenko’s” axes in “The Skyline is Burning” or “The Route to Taras.” I think I glorified and elevated an axe, this very simple, primitive tool, in homage to Shevchenko’s poetry, where he pleaded that we turn “high” cult objects (such as aspergills or thuribles) into tools or weapons. In the poem that we quoted in the project, Shevchenko dethroned such sacred artifacts, while I put “Shevchenko’s” axe (“…hone your axe and break their slumber”) on a pedestal.
                                        <br>It is worth noting that I’m comparing an axe to a monument unironically. Irony means that you surrendered and gave up on approaching things. To put it more bluntly, irony defuses the world, cools it out. I wanted to show how heavy and dangerous this blade was, how quickly it could turn from a tool into a weapon, and vice versa. I encoded another meaning of an axe, a tool instrumental to the creation of primal symbols, in my drawing “Lullaby. I’m a little boy, I’ll climb up a pole…”
                                        <br>While we are on the subject of artistic language, one couldn’t dream of a better metaphor. Of course, artistic language has to be intelligible and honest.
                                        <br>But how can artistic language escape the limitations of harrowing times?
                                        Hence, another question that arose in the first days of our insurrection remains open to this day: how honest can an artist be without hurting those whom he supports as a citizen?
                                        <br>I have not yet had the time to reflect on that when mounting my White Pages exhibition, comprised of the works that open the Kyiv Diary cycle. Kyiv, the very centre of it, was maimed and burning, and I could think of nothing else. It was all too close, although I’m not sure if a distance emerged even after the eye of battle moved to the east. But still, in those horrifying days in February one wouldn’t think about editing out certain things. It seemed like everybody would understand everything.
                                        <br>In Kyiv, I was enthralled by this communion; in Kaniv, I met people who destroyed things or drifted away from reality. When staying in Poet’s Refuge, I drew giant people in certain recognizable locations around Chernecha Mountain. I made a conscious choice to depict the most mundane spaces: a zebra crossing, a bus stop, indistinct shrubbery lining the road, the headlights of a car on the road, a hill. People remain indistinct too: normal people, everymen in their day-to-day mundane world, yet drawn to a different scale. These giants roam among mundane objects that they can no longer use, because those became too small for them.
                                        <br>Little wonder that we focused on poetic language in a project that had a lot to do with the image of Shevchenko. Nobody communicates in poetry in his or her day-to-day life. One could say that my “giants” started speaking in poetry: this made them unsuited to mundane tasks, but instead they gained the gift of changing reality.

                                            Poetic language is reality. We’ve focused on Shevchenko’s poetic language, but it’s in the nature of language as such, that is, not inane chatter but the poetic language, which offers the precise concentrated expression of our times. Without artistic language, reality disintegrates. Contained in artistic language, reality is preserved; it won’t ever drift into the past.
                                            <br>This way, Shevchenko’s poetic language – irrational, free of all affectation, forceful – offered the most precise expression of our present-day reality. To put a more forceful case, it encapsulates our present-day reality, as if Shevchenko himself came out to celebrate.
                                            <br>You are saying that some people gained powers to recast reality, but one cannot do that: reality can only be perceived, invented, mastered. Reality just is, once you look closely. For example, here I am, drawing a line, and it becomes the only reality for me: my reality is embodied in points where I “pull” the line to the surface or submerge it. This simple line, if drawn precisely, contains a treasure trove of information. The lines I draw have neither the past nor the present. When working, you create your own objects, you select them among the chimaeras of the real and embody them.
                                            <br>Doesn’t language itself retreat occasionally into silence?
                                            <br>Where else would it hide, if not in silence?
                                            <br>The things we thought we’ve lost just bide their time in a safe haven, and then resurface. And the things that do dissipate are usually inauthentic fakes.
                                            <br>I explored such concealment and revelation in language in my four monumental “Willows.” Out of the windows of my Kaniv studio, I could see the very same Dnieper willows that Shevchenko likely wrote about.
                                            <br>When I worked on them, I spoke softly, as if speaking to the depths. In my “Willows,” drawings barely break the surface of the canvas. I barely touched the canvas, laid my pigments subtly. I aimed to delineate the space where language turns back to its potentialities, retreats into silence.
                                            <br>I saw the white expanse of a canvas subsume, “devour” my willows. I submerged the willows into canvases, moving towards the starting point. I was returning to the times before the landscape entered language, as if Shevchenko had not yet depicted the wind that “shakes the willows.” The works are square, the format limits our line of vision, prevents the gaze from drifting upwards or sideways. Frontal view urges us to grasp the last traces of depictions that disappear as we speak, to search for footing that doesn’t exist outside the void, the primal pure whiteness of space.
                                            <br>Once I look closely at this white expanse, it occasionally yields something I yearn for, something that is mine.

                                            <br>In one of the first sheets of my Kyiv Diary, I’ve depicted a man dressed as an eye. I just met him on a street of the restless Kyiv. That must have been some advertising performance: a man with a giant eye for a head was walking towards me through an evening crowd. That must have been a sign.
                                            <br>Recently, I wrote that signs went wild and stopped hiding in the midst of the Kyiv events. They were no longer the obscure hints: they materialized as people and events, as if the language that objects spoke to me turned into a wail.
                                            <br>After that wail, Kaniv felt weird. It was so quiet I thought we’d gone deaf.
